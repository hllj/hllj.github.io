<p>My name is Hop Bui, an AI Engineer.</p>
<p>I love reading and writting, so I create this blog and make it a log website for my own</p>

<h3>About this site</h3>

<p> This website is a place where I can write down all stuffs I have done, my knowledge I have learned. Sometimes I would like to share my point of view about life and maybe my confessions so far.</p>

<p>There are 3 main purposes of this blog site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discuss about algorithms, technical details, mathematics in some projects or researchs I find interesting and would like to share to you guys.</li>
  <li>Sharing my thinking about everything in my life</li>
  <li>Document some record in my life (maybe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that all contents in my blog are just my own subjective point of view, they do not represent for a specific organization or a community.</p>
